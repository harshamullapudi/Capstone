Project Title - Performance Analysis of High-Speed Hybrid CMOS Full Adder Circuits for Low Voltage VLSI Design.

To study comparative analysis of high-speed and low-voltage full adder circuits.Â 
-To reduce the power consumption of digital circuits while maintaining low complexity of the logic design.
-To reduce the supply voltage which appears to be the well-known means to reduce power consumption.
-To design different styles of full adders.
-To simulate designs on cadence software.# Capstone
